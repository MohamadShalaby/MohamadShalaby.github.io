## Blazar driven beam-plasma instabilities in the IGM
  a) linear and quasi-linear analyses to study the evolution of the instabilities in linear and quasi-linear regimes.
  
  b) PIC simulations to study the linear and full non-linear evolution of the instabilities on both uniform and non-uniform background plasma.
  
  c) Search for GeV gamma-ray halos using data from the Fermi space telescope.


## Cosmic ray acceleration and propagation
  impacts for galaxies and galaxy clusters formation and evolution
